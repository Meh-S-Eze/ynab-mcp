      CRITICAL NOTICE: DO NOT MODIFY OR DIRECTLY USE THIS CODE
      
      All content in the External directory is strictly for REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY.
      This code should never be directly copied, included, imported, or otherwise
      incorporated verbatim into the MCP (My Cursor Project).
      
      The external code exists only as an architectural and functional reference when
      building our own implementation. Any similarities between our implementation
      and reference code should be limited to general architectural patterns and concepts.

mcp_guidelines:
  - "All code for this project must be original and not directly copied from external references"
  - "Use external references only to understand concepts, patterns, and approaches"
  - "When implementing similar functionality, write code from scratch with proper attribution"
  - "Maintain comprehensive DEBUG level logging as specified in the project requirements"
  - "Architectural inspiration is acceptable, but direct code reuse is prohibited"

reference_usage:
  permitted:
    - "Understanding general architecture and design patterns"
    - "Learning API interface requirements"
    - "Studying data structures for compatibility"
    - "Observing user experience flow"
  prohibited:
    - "Direct code copying or minimal modification"
    - "Importing or requiring external reference modules"
    - "Using external assets without proper licensing"
    - "Embedding snippets from reference code"

# MCP Server Development Protocol

⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT USE attempt_completion BEFORE TESTING ⚠️

## Step 1: Planning (PLAN MODE)
- What problem does this tool solve?
- What API/service will it use?
- What are the authentication requirements?
  □ Standard API key
  □ OAuth (requires separate setup script)
  □ Other credentials

## Step 2: Implementation (ACT MODE)
1. Bootstrap
   - For web services, JavaScript integration, or Node.js environments:
     ```bash
     npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server my-server
     cd my-server
     npm install
     ```
   - For data science, ML workflows, or Python environments:
     ```bash
     pip install mcp
     # Or with uv (recommended)
     uv add "mcp[cli]"
     ```

2. Core Implementation
   - Use MCP SDK
   - Implement comprehensive logging
     - TypeScript (for web/JS projects):
       ```typescript
       console.error('[Setup] Initializing server...');
       console.error('[API] Request to endpoint:', endpoint);
       console.error('[Error] Failed with:', error);
       ```
     - Python (for data science/ML projects):
       ```python
       import logging
       logging.error('[Setup] Initializing server...')
       logging.error(f'[API] Request to endpoint: {endpoint}')
       logging.error(f'[Error] Failed with: {str(error)}')
       ```
   - Add type definitions
   - Handle errors with context
   - Implement rate limiting if needed

3. Configuration
   - Get credentials from user if needed
   - Add to MCP settings:
     - For TypeScript projects:
       ```json
       {
         "mcpServers": {
           "my-server": {
             "command": "node",
             "args": ["path/to/build/index.js"],
             "env": {
               "API_KEY": "key"
             },
             "disabled": false,
             "autoApprove": []
           }
         }
       }
       ```
     - For Python projects:
       ```bash
       # Directly with command line
       mcp install server.py -v API_KEY=key
       
       # Or in settings.json
       {
         "mcpServers": {
           "my-server": {
             "command": "python",
             "args": ["server.py"],
             "env": {
               "API_KEY": "key"
             },
             "disabled": false,
             "autoApprove": []
           }
         }
       }
       ```

## Step 3: Testing (BLOCKER ⛔️)

<thinking>
BEFORE using attempt_completion, I MUST verify:
□ Have I tested EVERY tool?
□ Have I confirmed success from the user for each test?
□ Have I documented the test results?

If ANY answer is "no", I MUST NOT use attempt_completion.
</thinking>

1. Test Each Tool (REQUIRED)
   □ Test each tool with valid inputs
   □ Verify output format is correct
   ⚠️ DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL ALL TOOLS TESTED

## Step 4: Completion
❗ STOP AND VERIFY:
□ Every tool has been tested with valid inputs
□ Output format is correct for each tool

Only after ALL tools have been tested can attempt_completion be used.

## Key Requirements
- ✓ Must use MCP SDK
- ✓ Must have comprehensive logging
- ✓ Must test each tool individually
- ✓ Must handle errors gracefully
- ⛔️ NEVER skip testing before completion
